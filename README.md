an event based asynchronous **_monadic_** purely functional paradigm web programming language for controlling **_side effect orders/hustles_** of asynchronous event based/driven web page and application needs!

clearly saw that **_monads_** are right and nice way to go for controlling and managing **_side effect orders_** of 19X334.COM

will invent and make a new kind of language construct(s)/mechanism(s) in order to simplify using monads for everyone!

saw there is a metaphor called monad-transformers which what I have dreamed about:

will make a friendly language interface for using them in a compiled web language that runs in WebAssembly.

will start by reading:
